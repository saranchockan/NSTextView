# NSTextView-Expansion
NSTextView-Expansion is an app which allows the NSTextView to expand as you type.

# How does it work?
The app uses 'Anchors' to fix the edges of the NSTextView to the NSView. So when the user types, the NSView expands, thus forcing the NSTextView to expand. 
The manipulation of NSTextView occurs on different layers such as NSLayoutManager, NSTextStorage etc.
