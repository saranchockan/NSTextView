# NSTextView-Expansion
NSTextView-Expansion is an app which allows the NSTextView to expand as you type.

# How does it work?
The app uses 'Anchors' to fix the edges of the NSTextView to the NSView. So when the NSTextView expands, the NSTextView allows expands. 
The manipulation fo NSTextView occurs on its different layers such as NSLayoutManager, NSTextStorage etc.
